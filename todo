    > But add more confirmation steps or a undo button []
    > save button to save current status []
    > editing user password doesnt []
    > renaming username doesnt []
    > updating roles doesnt []
    > add logic to check if an existing username & role before updating those details []

  - Assign lecturers to their respective academic leaders []
  - Define APU grading system []
  - Create new classes for related modules []

flow & logic:
login > dashboard 
        > option to CRUD users
          > reads from accounts.txt lists out all users and their metadata
          > able to select any user modify their info, a drop down that indexes accounts.txt for roles etc to show available roles to change user to for example
          > maybe add refresh button to load in new data for outdated jframe

        > option to assign lecturers to their respective academic leaders
          > reads accounts.txt, filters out users that has roles "AcademicLeader" & "Lecturer"
          > have a page with 2 drop down menus, 1 academic leader another for lecturer
          > the lecturer will be assigned to the academic leader, upon clicking save it will write to a new file "AssignedLecturers.txt" for example
          > there will be a page that shows lecturers that are assigned to their AcademicLeaders
          > lecturers that arent assigned will have the status none beside them
          > how this works is by using the "AssignedLecturers.txt" file and comparing it to "Accounts.txt", filtering out lecturer role only
          > "Accounts.txt" has all existing lecturers and "AssignedLecturers.txt" has the asasigned ones
          > so if lecturers in "Accounts.txt" minus(-) "AssignedLecturers.txt" = lecturers left that arent assigned yet
          > format for AssignedLecturers.txt could be like:
            > AcademicLeader1: lec1, lec2, lec3
            > following lecturers could be concatinated behind the last added lectuerer of an AcademicLeader with a period 
          
        > option to define APU grading system
          > "GradingSystem.txt" stores grades in format:
            > A+ = 95%
            > A = 90%
            > A- = 85%
            > and there will be logic checking if there are same marks assigned to same grade etc
          > this file will be used and read to compare students marks to assign a grade

        > option to create new classes for related modules
          > reads "modules" file created by AcademicLeaders
          > page with drop down again to match classes to modules
          > once matches are saved it will be saved to "Classes.txt"
          > data could be stored in this format:
            > Module1 : class1, class2, class3
            > stored similar to AssignedLecturers file
        
        > ALL files containing data could be exported as csv (features)
        > Data will be displayed in a table like format (some selectable to CRUD)
        
        > updated way of storing data in "AssignedLecturers.txt"
          > AL001|L001
          > AL001|L002
          > AL002|L003
          > or just AL001,L001 csv
          > Easier comparing
          > Easier validation
          > Easier CSV export
          > Easier future extension
          > same goes for "GradingSystem.txt" & "Classes.txt"
          > Implement searchbar to index items
